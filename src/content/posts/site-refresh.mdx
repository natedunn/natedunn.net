## The vibe check

Another year, another site refresh. Though only six months after my last (delayed) refresh. I felt pretty bogged down by my last iteration. Maybe it has something to do with me not vibing with using Next.js for primarily static sites. Or it could be the **FOMO** of not using Astro.

I scratched the itch a little by building a [starter kit for Astro]('/posts/hello-headroom'), but I knew that I wanted to rebuild my personal site sooner than later.

## What were the goals

I had a few goals in mind when I booted up a new repo:

- **Make it simple**: I wanted it to be reminiscent of sites of old. White background, default link colors, dial up modem sounds. I wanted to make it as simple as possible. And this would play a role in the other two goals.
- **Make it fast**: I wanted it to load as fast as possible. Static, system fonts, as few styles as possible to prevent bloat. Astro makes this part easy.
- **Make it easy to maintain**: Maintaining our own sites isn't always fun, so why make the dev part any harder than it needs to be. With [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) I am able to maintain past and future content more easily.

## What's coming

I have a few fun ideas for the future of this site. I think I want to keep this version around for longer than I typically do so I can invest a little more. Even still, in the long term I want to keep the original goals in mind by keeping things simple, fast, and maintainable.
